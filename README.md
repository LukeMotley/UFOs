# UFOs

## Overview

In this project, a large dataset of UFO sightings are given in Javascript. An HTML page is created to professionally display the organized data with a series of filters to view the sightings in different ways.

This project covers:
Javascript,
HTML


## Results:
When viewing the page, after the indroductory paragraphs to the left of the page, there are various filters. These filters take the main table of sightings and their stats and filters them so users can search for specific data.

If they want to search a day, city, state, country, or shape of UFO, they would need to type there specifications in the appropriate boxes. Once they do that, the table will limit all information that does not fit what the user desires.

## Summary
 Although a nice webpage, there are a few adjustments that would help the use of the page. For one, being about to select a range in the dates would be very helpful, instead of searching one date at a time. It would also be beneficial to show a drop down of values when clicking on certain filters. For example, if a user were to ckick the 'city' box, a drop down of cities that have at least one entry would appear. This would keep someone from typing a city just to find that there have not been any sightings in that particular city. I think the website would also benefit from a 'clear' button to clear out the filters so someone can make a new query without having to delete everything in the filters individually.
